Creating a user management API with Node.js and Express
Now, we’ll create the following API endpoints for user management:

POST /signup: Registering a new user
POST /login: Logging in
GET /user: Retrieving a user’s profile (restricted to the user themselves)
PATCH /user/:userId: Updating a user’s profile (restricted to the user themselves)
GET /user/all: Retrieving all users (available to all users)
PATCH /user/change-role/:userId: Updating a user’s role (restricted to admins)
DELETE /user/:userId: Deleting a user (restricted to admins)


We’ll also look at how you can use JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to set up authentication for certain endpoints.
